Doodad Dash is a deep-learning powered computer vision party game which uses your camera to find objects in your environment.

At the start of a round, players select an object for the other players to find. All players then have 3 minutes to find each others objects. The winner is the player who finds all objects the fastest, or who has the most objects at the end of the timer.
